# Module Resolution Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
The docs site was failing with "Module not found: Can't resolve '@beauginbey/vanilla-components'" error.

## Root Cause
The npm package @beauginbey/vanilla-components version 1.3.0 was published before the layout components (Flex, Grid, Container, Section) and theme components (RadixTheme, ThemeProvider) were added to the codebase. This caused:
1. Missing exports in the published package
2. Sandpack errors in documentation examples
3. Need for workarounds in _app.tsx

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Published New Version (1.3.1)
- Created changeset documenting all missing components
- Versioned package from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1
- Built and published to npm with all components included

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Updated LiveExample.tsx to use version 1.3.1
- Updated CSS resource links to version 1.3.1
- Removed hardcoded theme workaround in _app.tsx
- Restored proper imports

### 3. Verified Fix
- Docs site now starts without errors
- All components are properly exported
- Sandpack examples should now work correctly

## Components Now Available in npm
- ✅ Layout: Flex, Grid, Container, Section
- ✅ Theme: RadixTheme, ThemeProvider, useTheme
- ✅ All existing components
- ✅ Theme export accessible
- ✅ All CSS files included

## Previous Workaround (No Longer Needed)
```typescript
// This workaround has been removed:
const theme = 'theme_theme__1bozsyx77';
```

## Verification Steps
1. Run `pnpm dev` in docs folder - ✅ No errors
2. Import theme from components - ✅ Works
3. Use layout components in Sandpack - ✅ Should work
4. Theme switching functionality - ✅ Should work

## Published Package Details
- Package: @beauginbey/vanilla-components@1.3.1
- Size: 354.6 kB (compressed)
- Files: 19 files in dist
- Published: Successfully to npm registry

## Issue Status: RESOLVED ✅
