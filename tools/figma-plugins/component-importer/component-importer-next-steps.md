# Suggested Next Steps for Figma Plugin Development

Now that we have working token and component importers with proper documentation, here are the recommended next steps:

## 1. **Expand Component Library** (Priority: High)
Add more components that are already in the vanilla design system:
- **Form Components**: Already have specs for Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Switch
- **Layout Components**: Box (with Sprinkles support), Stack, Grid
- **Typography Component**: Text with all variants
- **Feedback Components**: Alert, Toast, Badge

## 2. **Add Interactive States** (Priority: Medium)
Implement Figma's interactive component features:
- Hover states with proper color transitions
- Focus states with focus rings
- Active/pressed states
- Disabled state styling
- Use Figma's prototyping features

## 3. **Icon Support** (Priority: Medium)
- Create an icon library importer
- Support for icon swapping in components
- Handle different icon sizes based on component size

## 4. **Theme Switching** (Priority: Medium)
- Add UI to switch between light/dark modes in Figma
- Update all components to reflect theme changes
- Support for custom theme colors (accent color switching)

## 5. **Component Documentation** (Priority: Low)
- Add component descriptions in Figma
- Document prop options
- Add usage examples as additional frames

## 6. **Quality Improvements** (Priority: High)
- Add tests for the plugins
- Better error messages with specific solutions
- Progress indicators for long operations
- Batch import capabilities

## 7. **Developer Experience** (Priority: Medium)
- Add a CLI tool to generate component specs from React components
- Auto-generate TypeScript types from Figma components
- Add component search/filtering in the UI

## 8. **Advanced Features** (Priority: Low)
- Component update detection (sync changes from code)
- Export Figma components back to code
- Design token sync (two-way binding)
- Integration with design handoff tools

Which direction would you like to explore first? The form components are ready to implement, or we could focus on adding interactive states to make the components more realistic.
